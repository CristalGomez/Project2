# DrinksOnUs
DrinksOnUs allows our clients to find a forum page to their favorite bars in their city with the most recent happy hour specials. Bars are always changing up their happy hours and their menus aren't always very descriptive. The DrinksOnUs forum allows users to leave comments about the happy hour specials and be as descriptive as they would like.
